# Location Map Project

## Description
The project integrates Leaflet in an Angular application that is located inside the `app` folder.
It allows users to switch between basemaps and to overlay map layers. They can also zoom to a specific location by entering its coordinates.

The data required for loading all the map's layers is fetched from a Node.js server. The server application is located inside the `server` folder. 

## Running the project

To run the project:

Navigate to the `server` folder. Run `npm install` (if it is the first time) and then `npm start` or `npm run dev`.

Navigate to the `client` folder. Run `npm install` (if it is the first time) and then `npm start`.

Now the application should be running at `localhost:4200`
